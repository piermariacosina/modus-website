  book_preview: "The publication is a tribute to this great capital city, the

                 bridge between East and West.<br /><br />

                 Alongside the images of Mauro Guglielminotti, the writer

                 Esmahan Aykol, the artist Mehmet Güreli, the journalist

                 and film director Metin Yegin and the actress Fusun

                 Demirel tell us of charming and intimate parts of the city.<br /><br />

                 Orsola Casagrande, a journalist, proposes an insight of

                 current politics. The photographs by Mauro Guglielminotti

                 are the common thread crossing cultural, social and

                 political realities of this great Turkish town. A visual

                 journey that starts in 1997 and ends with the last

                 summer’s event in Taksim Square .<br /><br />"
  book_intro: "This book offers a vision of a different and original

                                Istanbul. It inserts elements of curiosity that lead out of

                                the classic, stereotyped circuits. This book will activate all

                                your senses to discover the best that Istanbul can offer to

                                a careful visitor. This book, the first of a series, is unique

                                in that it tells the city through the eyes but also the words

                                of those who live the city every day. <br /><br />

                                Photographs and texts are used to help you to better see,

                                understand and share how the places have changed and

                                evolved. <br /><br />

                                Traditional technology –books- and modern technology

                                -computer supports- are to be put in a backpack, to be

                                looked at before you leave or to be read during a break on

                                the journey, are the natural compendium that the traveler

                                can have with him while traveling. In this sense “Istanbul”

                                is also a perfect blend of the old and the new. A little like

                                the city that overlooks the Bosphorus.<br /><br />
